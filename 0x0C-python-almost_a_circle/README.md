* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
* You have to use the unittest module
* All your test files should be python files `(extension: .py)`
* All your test files and folders should start with `test_`
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base.py`
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest` discover tests
* You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you donâ€™t miss any edge case
